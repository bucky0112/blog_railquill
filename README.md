# Personal Blog                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
My personal blog built with Railquill - a Rails 8.0 blog engine with static site generation.                                                                                                                                                                                 
This is my personal blog powered by my own open-source project [Railquill](https://github.com/bucky0112/railquill). I use it to write about technology, development, and share my thoughts on various topics.                                                                

**Note**: This is a personal instance of the Railquill blog engine that I developed. The original open-source project is available separately.
